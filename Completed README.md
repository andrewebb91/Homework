## Javascript is hard because it like a foreign language to me 

_Goals I look to accomplosh this course._

1. I would like to learn this Javascript language seeing as though it is the bases of the tech world.
2. I would like to create a true cohort atmosphere where we will be able to stay in touch after the course. 
3. I would like to create reliable web application that will later become a person project of mine.
4. Continue to grow my interest in computer science and coding.
